All thanks to him for his fine work.

== Description ==

This class can extract proper nouns from texts.

It takes a text string and can detect which words may be proper nouns of people, entities, etc..

It uses some heuristics like the capitalization of the first word letter, the presence of people title preceeding the nouns, etc..

The class may consider consecutive proper names as a single proper name.

The class assumes English by default but may be configure to work with other idioms.
